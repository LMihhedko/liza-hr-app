# :clipboard: Human Resources App :woman_office_worker::man_office_worker:	

## Overview

This application is a CRUD app. It was created for HR departments as it can be useful for storing company employee data.

:round_pushpin:	To make this app, for the front end I used Vue.js 3 with Composition API and TailWind CSS for a faster CSS design process and to mantain the code easier, also the responsiveness is a big plus.<br />
:round_pushpin:	For the back end I used the BaaS platform Supabase, because it is a relational database. 

The application has a Log In/ Sign Up page, where users can log in or create an account to be able to use the app. Once the user has logged in, it shows a dashboard and allows them to view the list of employees, modify the data of existing employees, add new employees and delete them. 

This app is also available on mobile version. :iphone:	

In the future I would like to implement more sections such as "My Account", "Calendar", "Analytics" so the app has more functionalities.
